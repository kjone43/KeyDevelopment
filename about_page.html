		    How Did I Get Into Web Development? 
		    </h2>
                <p>
                While my background was orginally in Exercise Science, not satifised with the field and it's prospects - I was in search for a change. My intial interest into the IT/Programming world was graphic design, but to be better equipped I took it back to the basics. About a year ago, I taught myself several programming languages including HTML, Java Script, and Python. Key Development has been in the prototype stages for almost a year now!

            Future of Key Development?
            </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky is the limit! Key Development will eventually expand into graphic design, web management, etc. As these skills are gathered, Key Development will be updated accordingly.
